Please Note
=========
- You can place a CSV file similar to the default file (/data/eth/fs18_mobile-gis/TreasureGo/app/src/main/res/raw/treasures.csv) into the root of your external storage directory. If the app finds a file called "teasures.csv" at the path returned by "getExternalStorageDirectory()", it will load that file. If there is no such file available it will load the default file.
- The arrow pointing to the target Treasure is not reliable when you get close to the Treasure (within 20-50 meters). This is due to inaccuracies of the estimated Locations. If the arrow does not work well for further distance, you can calibrate your sensors.
- When you get closer than 20m to the Target, you will have found it.
