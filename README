TreasureGo
=========
This repository contains the source code of TreasureGo Android version 1.0.0.

TreasureGo is a game similar to PokémonGO. Instead of searching for Pokémons, we search for Treasures.

Have fun!


Please Note
=========
- The arrow pointing to the target Treasure is not reliable when you get close to the Treasure (within 20-50 meters). This is due to inaccuracies of the estimated Locations. If the arrow does not work well for further distance, you can calibrate your sensors.
- When you get closer than 20m to the Target, you will have "found" it.
